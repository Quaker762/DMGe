#Building
Building (as of now) is a *relatively* painless task on both Linux and Windows.
Firstly, you must gather as follows (these could be subject to change):
**-boost 1.57**
**-wxWidgets 3.0.0**

The preferred IDE is Code::Blocks

Once these are built, simply add all the necessary paths to your project settings and compile!
